**Standard Input**
1. `cat` seems like it is hanging because it is waiting for a user input to stdin.

2. When you run `cat` and type a message in the terminal, it echoes the message
   back to you. You enter the message into standard input (stdin) and it writes
   the result to standard output (stdout).


**Pipes**
2. ls | sort -r

3. echo "hello world" | cat

4. echo "hello world"


**Standard Error**
1. There is a lot of files with metadata like wrx permissions, timestamps, filenames,
   users, etc in sorted.txt. There was no output in the terminal, and no error output
   as standard error. This is because when there is no error to be printed, there is
   nothing output to standard error.p
