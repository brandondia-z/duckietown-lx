2. There is no output.

4. `roscore` communicates using ROSCPP, primarily transporting using TCP/IP.


**Talking to Your Robot**
1. We can solve this many ways, three of which being using NMap to find the devices on the network and picking ours;
   pinging the drone hostname to connect to the drone; and finally (and not advised) connecting to every IP address
   on the network and hoping you get the right one.


**Look Ma, No Internet**
1. If the robot is set to act as a Wifi hotspot, then the robot is acting as the DHCP server.

2. (I have not finished building my duckiedrone yet so I don't have the duckiedrone IP address). My IP
   address is 128.148.207.120. 

3. Instead of using the robot as a wireless AP Master, we can use an ad-hoc network between the laptop and
   the robot. We don't need the Wifi network to connect the laptop and the robot, since each device can
   connect directly to each other.

4. Router based setup (using a portable router to establish a local network, where the router assigns an IP
   address to each device and they can communicate with each other); Direct ethernet connection (directly
   connect the base station to the robot with an ethernet cable, connecting the devices); Cell phone tethering
   (create a local network with a cell phone's tethering, connecting both devices to the cell network and cellular
   data)
